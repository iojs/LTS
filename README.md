# io.js Long-term Support Working Group

## Goal

Define and execute a long-term support (LTS) plan for the io.js process.

1. Identify LTS branch points in the io.js repository and define lifecycle for each branch.
2. Clearly communicate the policy for each LTS branch, including how long it is expected to be supported and when it will be deprecated.
3. Monitor the io.js codebase for bug fixes and patches that should be backported to active LTS branches.
4. Set up a release process for each LTS branch, including a list of authorized releasers and a release methodology compatible with the methodology used for non-LTS io.js releases.
5. Monitor vendored dependencies, including libuv, V8 and OpenSSL for important updates that are compatible with the LTS release schedule.
6. Accept support responsibility for vendored dependencies that are no longer supported upstream.
